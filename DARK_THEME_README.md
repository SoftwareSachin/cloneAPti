## Technical Implementation

### CSS Variables
The theme uses CSS custom properties for consistent theming:
```css
:root {
  --background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --foreground: hsl(222, 84%, 4.9%);
  /* ... other light theme variables */
}

.dark {
  --background: hsl(224, 71%, 4%);
  --foreground: hsl(213, 31%, 91%);
  /* ... other dark theme variables */
}
```

### Theme Provider
```tsx
<ThemeProvider defaultTheme="dark" storageKey="aptivon-theme">
  {/* App content */}
</ThemeProvider>
```

<ThemeToggle />
```
